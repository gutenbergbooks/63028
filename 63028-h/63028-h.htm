</div>

<p class='c006'>On, and on, and on! For interminable
hours had we been rushing
headlong over yellowish-brown plains,
punctuated here and there by willow-fringed
streams; past huge water-tanks
standing guard over dreary little
cabins already cowering before the
approach of fierce wintry assaults;
past forlorn specimens of unkempt
and altogether hopeless humanity, who
straggled away toward invisible habitations
beyond the horizon, or, swaddled
in accumulated filth and ragged
shawls, squatted in solemn stolidity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>by the roadside for a vanishing glimpse
of fleeting civilization.</p>

<p class='c007'>From profitless window-gazing,
to that supposedly restful twist invariably
assumed by the weary woman-traveler;
from contemplation of barren
and boundless distance without, to
closed eyes and anxious retrospection,
within; from the sterility of facts present,
to the incomparably cruel suggestions
of merciless imagination, involving
the health, happiness, even
the life of loved ones left behind;—till,
gradually, Creation resolved itself
into a jumble of indefinable sounds
and fancies;—a rumbling, jolting,
wheezing dizziness:</p>

<p class='c007'>A crash and lurch brought every
would-be-dozer to his feet, the train
suddenly ceased moving, and apprehensive
of danger, we promptly responded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>to the peremptory call: “All
out here!” to find ourselves on a wide
springy platform surrounding a station-building
quite unlike any previously
observed; in an atmosphere laden with
the perfume of—was it pine-woods—newly
mown hay—violets—lilies or
jasmine?</p>

<p class='c007'>It seemed rather a mixture of
many delicious odors. Fertile fields
and wooded hills stretched away before
us; men, women and children in
ideal peasant costumes moved gaily
about, chatting together, singing,
dancing over the velvety sod, or leaping
and swinging from the supple
boughs while pelting each other with
blossoms or gathering the luscious
fruit which was everywhere temptingly
abundant.</p>

<p class='c007'>Through the shrubbery, glimpses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>of rock-built and vine-covered homes
told of individual prosperity; flowering
mosses outlined the roadways; and
luxuriant hedges, also in full bloom,
divided the grounds one from another;
fountains and myriad birds filled the
air with happy melodies.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hand in hand, a dark-eyed lad
and a fair-haired lassie approached, saluted,
and simultaneously asked in
voices perfectly attuned, “Guides for
the city?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Urban instincts immediately awakened
and asked, “How far is it,
and how much—by the hour?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, gracefully and respectfully
saluting, they replied, “This is
the Center; the Fields are to the right
and left; our services are paid by the
government.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Slightly disconcerted at such unexpected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>hospitality, but also convinced
that our reputation as workers
for the elevation of mankind had preceded
us, and rather self-exalted
thereby, we said, affably enough;
“Very well; let the young lady show
us about.” With an indulgent smile,
they explained, “We always help
each other.” (“Born twins likely,”
being our mental comment.)</p>

<p class='c007'>“These buildings near the Depot,
for the convenience of producers and
consumers, are the Supply Stations,
whence are shipped the government
products from fields and factories.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Producers are supplied at cost,
non-producers at a small advance.
The general Store-houses are farther
down this, the Poplar Valley, but
also on the line of public travel.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Mother-fields are to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>right, in the Maple-valley, while the
Father-fields fill the Elm-valley, to
the left.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yonder, where the hill-side appears
checked with different tints, are
the Schools of Natural History.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Schools?” we interrupted, quite
prepared to exploit the superiority of
certain educational institutions farther
east, in the organization and regulation
of which we had offered several
valuable suggestions: “How many
schools have you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They vary according to our
needs; one for every ten students,
from four to twenty years of age.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We neglected to dilate upon the
immense advantages of our systems.
We may have been intoxicated by the
invigorating atmosphere, the beautiful
scene, or the chanting and enchanting
guides.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>We did, however, venture to ask,
deprecatingly, “Do you study only
Natural History?”</p>

<p class='c007'>With a merry laugh, they answered,
“Indeed! That is much, we
think: To learn of the birth, growth,
development and decay of Nature’s
products, from the tiniest manifestation
of life—animal, vegetable and
mineral—to man’s perfect evolution,
from this physical form into spirituality.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We, children, learn only the
rudiments of each change, the Scientists
and Philosophers make it their
life work.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And live and die poor, here as
elsewhere?” we facetiously suggested.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed, no!” they answered again,
with a merry peal of laughter
at so dire a possibility. “We have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>no ‘poor’ as you call them. The government
is the friend of everyone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With a skeptical sniff, and a
suspicion that we were in the heart of
one of those “Ideal communities,” of
whose birth, growth and early collapse
we had read, we asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where are the other schools, or
are those enough for your population?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“On Bald Hill, toward the east—you
can see the brick buildings and
scaffoldings—are the schools for Mechanics;
where those who are so fitted
by heredity, learn the use of tools
and machinery.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The children of mechanics, must
then follow their father’s calling?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not necessarily: If a carpenter-man
does not wish to raise carpenter-children,
he seeks a wife among the
farmers, philosophers, professions or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>wherever his preferences tend. Their
united desire calls to their home souls
harmonious, in development with their
intentions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your people have not yet learned
this law—in Natural History;” with
a roguish twinkle, “it is taught in
our lowest grades.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Taught to children?” we asked
horrified at this depravity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To little children. Your people
ignorantly imagine marriage and birth
a game of chance, attended by much
nonsense and immorality; in which
parents may draw anything from a
blank or a monstrosity to a saint. You
are here to learn the beautiful truth;—or
as much of it as you are capable
of grasping.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Their conversation seemed so illy
fitted to their years, that we asked
their age.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>“Fifteen and eighteen years of
this incarnation, while you are nearly
fifty; but, in Eternity, we are your
seniors and can teach you to crush
the shell by which Earth-children
have surrounded themselves.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You speak of ‘Earth-children;’—are
you not of them?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; this is Reinstern. You
have been brought to us to learn the
possibilities of your people.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Isn’t Reinstern in the western
part of the United States?” we asked,
greatly mystified.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a planet as yet undiscovered
by your astronomers, who waste
lifetimes searching with telescopes for
what the inner vision will readily disclose
when you allow the real self to
predominate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is a flimsy dream, after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>all,” was our immediate conclusion,
which though unexpressed, was quickly
answered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No; you are not dreaming; but
thoroughly awake, at last. Upon your
planet, generation after generation
have been given over to materialism
and hypocrisy; till Life, which is only
embodied in Love and Truth, is nearly
extinct; it is, in your best, torpid.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Again and again have Teachers
and Physicians from a higher
plane of existence been clothed in
your Earth-garb, and lived among
you that your eyes might be opened.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have either persecuted or
shunned them, but occasionally, after
their departure, dully recognizing
their mission and superiority, have
worshipped their materialization; giving
no heed to their precepts.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>“It is now feared, among the
sister-planets, that Earth will lose her
spirituality, which is her life, and become,
again, a nonentity among the
spheres; a mass of corruption which
must, eventually, return to its original
state of floating matter, to be elsewhere
utilized.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As all progress in humanity is
accomplished through loving effort for
the good of others, Reinstern is now
making a vigorous attempt to elevate
your people; to teach them the great
truth that soul-life is one with Universal
life, and must be allowed its
only expression, Love; not love in
the corrupt sense, received by most
of your people, which is not Love at
all, but only a low grade of selfishness.
True Love seeks the good of all, and
thereby, wins the best for self. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>too is selfishness; but such is a duty.
The Father has clothed us in individuality,
that we may, through our own
exertions, become stronger in virtue;
unless we avail ourselves of the opportunities
he supplies, we are ungrateful
and unworthy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Our bodies are self-built Temples
in which to worship, not the outward
manifestations of His power, but His
Spirit of Love, which, though all-pervading,
all-knowing, all-powerful and
all-loving, must ever be invisible to
finite eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“According as we truly worship
and enjoy all within human possibilities,
recognizing His presence in every
blessing, we live; if we ignore Love’s
voice, we are committing suicide,
crowding out of the physical, Life;
hastening the decay,—individual, national
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>and planetary, which inevitably
follows injustice and unkindness. This
decay manifests itself in your ill-health,
moral and physical.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do Reinstern people all speak
English?” we asked, rather quizzically,
after this broadside of philosophy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have been magnetically
prepared for this experience, and
psychically understand all that is presented:
this is in the hands of the electrical
students,—is one of their object
lessons.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Were it possible for you to
come here unattended and unheralded,
you would see, hear and understand
nothing, as our language resembles
your thought communication. We
are not so advanced in spirituality as
in many other planets, the inhabitants
of which float in the atmosphere at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>will, conversing at all distances as
freely as you with your family around
the breakfast table. With such the
physical is quite subordinate to the
spirit; but we are much above your
plane and do not appear materialized
in your eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your spirit is, for the time,
magnetically maintained by those who
are striving for the salvation of Earth
from annihilation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will carry your experience
back to your people, and devote your
life to their uplifting. The physical
life of those fortunate Earth inhabitants
who have been found susceptible
to our efforts, will be greatly prolonged
by our people, that all possible
good may be accomplished.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After a few minutes—or hours, of
riding,—or was it floating? we found
ourselves in Maple Valley.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Would that we were sufficiently
gifted to paint that wondrously beautiful
scene! to portray the glories of
human life among the Good, the Pure,
the True, the Happy! It were then
indeed an object lesson to all of
Earth’s sorrowing people.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the left, lay broad fields of
grains and grasses, bending timidly
before the fervent caress of August
zephyrs; gardens of unfamiliar fruits
and vegetables stretched before us;
to the right rose tier after tier of
grassy knolls dotted with low, spreading
shrubbery; while farther up the
slope, ideal groves of magnificent
Maples, seemed beckoning to the
pleasure-lovers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perfectly developed humanity
supplied the Highlights for the fascinating
picture. The grassy knolls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>swarmed with babyhood, whose rosy-cheeked
mothers in gay colored, tunic-like
garbs, busied themselves among
the rustling foliage;—pruning, training,
planting and cultivating.</p>

<p class='c007'>One could hardly believe that
work, considered by us as too laborious,—nay—positively
injurious for womankind,
was being accomplished by this
band of merry-makers.</p>

<p class='c007'>When we could distract our attention
from the bewildering scene,
the guides were saying: “These fields
are tilled and the crops harvested by
the mothers of the Yearlings, as you
see.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who owns or controls the fields
and pays for the labor?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is government land.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“—and the government?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“—is officered by citizens who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>have outlived the parental term and
successfully graduated into full citizenship
three or more children.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After our mumbled comment,
“A premium on parentage, at last,”
we asked: “Who takes care of the
‘Yearlings,’ as you have called them?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Their mothers;” with a puzzled
look at each other—“with a little help
from the Applicants after noon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Women doing farm work and
baby-tending? That seems incredible;”
we exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a peal of happy laughter
that proved contagious, and a quickly
executed, waltz-like whirl of amusement,
they preceded the explanation:
“Until children pass their first birthday,
they accompany their mothers
daily to these fields, to roll about on
the sod, dig in the soil or sleep in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>their baskets, while their mothers
plant, prune, graft, harvest or cultivate
according to the season; meanwhile,
the Applicants are attending
to the house and preparing for the
noon home-coming; after which they
share the Yearling duties.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who are the Applicants?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Young men and maidens, who
desire to marry, after having passed
with honor through several departments
of Education and Preparation;
and, by the State Records, have proved
their ability to provide for the material
and spiritual needs of a family;
and have received, from the Board of
Public Health their Certificates of
physical fitness, are granted the Applicant’s
degree.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This entitles them to assist and
relieve Fathers and Mothers in their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>home and field duties, until they pass
their twenty-fifth birthdays and have
selected life partners. If they can
then show records of at least one
year’s satisfactory administration of
such duties, the Government issues
their Marriage-license.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is, in every family, a period
of great rejoicing; each licensed
child being then honored by visits
and gifts from all relatives and friends;
and, if he or she happens to have
merited special recognition from the
city or State, by any act of peculiar
heroism or self-sacrifice, the Officials
add a generous tribute.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In some notable cases, the
bride or groom must build a house in
which to store the Ante-wedding
presents.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You make as much of the license-granting
as of the wedding?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>“The public is not expected to
take cognizance of the wedding day.
It would be regarded on Reinstern,
as grossly immodest and cruel, to call
general attention to the exact hour
wherein the young couple are legally
empowered to exercise the marital
privileges. It is the culmination of
the most sacred desires of the human
heart.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As with curtained eyes, they
bowed modestly before us, we felt unaccountably
ashamed of our crude
practices, though but dimly comprehending
the mystic purity of which
we were thus vouchsafed a brief
glimpse.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shall we tell you more of the
fielding system?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is there more?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have heard but the beginning.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>While the mothers and applicants
are thus busied, the fathers are
caring for the three-year-olds, the
Buds, in the Elm-valley,—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“—and the two-year-olds are at
home with the servants?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We have no servants; there is
no dominating or servile class; all try
to serve the same Divine Will, as interpreted
by the Higher Self.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Our oldest citizens are advisers
in time of doubt; being more highly
developed and able to read the Truth
more clearly through the delicate material
veil they will soon discard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Death can have no terrors for
them?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What you term ‘Death’, the
change to the next higher plane of
materiality, is, with us, but the passing
of night-time; we anticipate the
glories of the approaching dawn.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>“You are to see this change before
you leave us. You asked of the
two-year-olds, or, as we know them,
the Restless. They are in the charge of
the recently married women, who
thus acquire a practical knowledge of
the motherhood to which they aspire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They, also have field and garden
duties, not so absorbing or laborious
as those of the parents, for two
reasons: The Restless need rather
more attention than the Yearlings;
and the young wives themselves require
more leisure for study and preparation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But who earns the living for
the family?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again the waltzing whirl of suppressed
amusement, before they said
gravely: “Parents are the highest
priced laborers in the land; mothers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>and fathers receiving equal honors,
salaries and privileges.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is all very beautiful—very—too
beautiful to be true.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is true; and its simplicity
brings its realization within the reach
of all. It must be realized by Earth:
You have the conditions, everything,
except the will to accomplish the
change. All blessings are yours to
take. You are only self-blinded; and
by your bigotry, are in danger of
blood-poisoning.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bathe your eyes in Truth; open
them to His everlasting and all-powerful
Love, and wash away the putrefaction
that threatens your Eternal
welfare, your planet’s existence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A radiant light enveloped them,
an invisible choir flooded the air with
celestial harmonies; we bowed ourselves,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>reverently, before an unseen
but overpowering presence, and covering
our faces answered, fervidly:
“With Thy help, Lord, we will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“After the third year?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The recently married men receive
the graduating Buds into the
Youth’s department, and devote their
first year to them; their work is also
in the open air and completes the
Field course.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After these young benedicts
promote a class of Youth, they receive
their full certificates of Fatherhood.
They are then of age, as you
would call it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are not many of these young
people unfit for the responsibilities,
the custody of children, the field
work or—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have forgotten that marriage-licenses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>are granted only after
the Applicants are fully qualified.
Our Committee on Generation thoroughly
investigate every case.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The five-year-olds?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are taken in groups of ten, by
teachers, who, during the following
two years, instruct them in the first
principles of birth, growth and change
as presented by plant and animal life in
field, forest, garden and home: This
includes much you would classify as
rudiments of Physiology, Chemistry,
Astronomy, Psychology, Paleontology,
Arithmetic, Language, Geography,
History and Agriculture, besides
Cleaning and Cooking. It is accomplished
however without books or
tablets, and, much of it outside the
class-rooms.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Flowers, fruits, vegetables and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>grains; birds, fish, reptiles and many
other forms of animal life, are germinated
and developed to maturity;
nurtured and experimented upon; but
ever to the benefit of the life involved.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are your teachers men or women?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Both; always in pairs; the government
believing that by constant
and familiar association, only, can
the present standard of purity and
liberty be maintained.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A strain of flute-like music interrupted
us. “A sick call,” explained
the guides. “You see the flags floating
from occasional nursery knolls;
they locate ailing babes, and demand
attention from any passing mother;
while every staff-whistle is distinctive
and quickly recognized by the mother
whose offspring has special need of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>her presence. Knowing this, each is
free from that harrowing anxiety experienced
by Earth mothers, who
must watch constantly over their
teething or otherwise ailing little
ones; or suffer untold agonies with
apprehension, during an absence; thus
poisoning the nourishment, in preparation,
which Nature intends to serve
as a cure for every infantile ill.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But it seems positively cruel to
force mothers with sick children into
the field.” We were really indignant
about it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again those merry children
laughed in great glee at our innocence:
“Reinstern mothers are forced
to—nothing; they are their own sovereigns.
They have fitted themselves
for their positions, and their responsibilities
are the greatest possible—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>reproduction of the race. Their salaries
are generous, and continue without
interruption or diminution
throughout the parental term.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How long is that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never more than fifteen years,
though contingent upon the age of
marriage. The term limit, in years,
is from forty to forty five.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How do parents invest their
earnings?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“According to individual tastes
and preferences. As with you, many
have beautiful homes, with extensive
grounds, indulge in Art Galleries,
Libraries, Theaters, or Conservatories,
while others devote the later years to
special sciences or enter the School of
Physicians.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then even this hygienic regime
entails occasional illness?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>“Accidents will always attend
immaturity and inexperience; Infinite
Wisdom alone can insure perfect harmony;
but our physicians are also a
salaried class, who teach as well as
heal. Ill health which incapacitates
members of his families for daily usefulness,
is recorded against the physician;
and a succession of such reports
count to his discredit, even to
the extent of depriving him of his
diploma. In such cases, he, through
the advice of the sages, seeks a less
responsible avocation, or one for
which he is better qualified.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We do not, like you, bribe our
doctors to neglect their patients or
retard their cure.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Our medical course is in three
departments: Chemistry, Magnetism
and Materia Medica. The first concerns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>the elements and combinations
forming the physical body of man.
Magnetism teaches the application of
these principles and elements to
the upbuilding and repairing of the
body, while in Materia Medica we are
taught to locate and extract these required
principles from the animal,
vegetable and mineral world. We
hope to be physicians, after a time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This wish was uttered with a
deep joyousness that told of a riper
understanding than is expressed when
the Earth-born youngster, during a
brief cessation from banister-sliding
or somersault-turning, exclaims, “I
am going to be a doctor—a lawyer—or
a policeman,” and yet there was an
enthusiasm that was almost a parallel.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have not mentioned lawyers.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>“We have none; yours are an
outgrowth of dishonesty and cruelty;
a finger pointing to dissolution.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your law is a demoralizing human
rule, through the enforcement of
which you would compel mankind to
do what should be in accordance with
his ardent desire. If he disobeys your
petty law, you inflict penalties;—even
daring to shorten his physical existence.
From the effects of this treatment,
he, like you, must suffer for
ages to come, so seriously is his growth
retarded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We, on the other hand, feel
deeply humiliated by any act of wrong
among our people, which demands public
notice; it reflects upon the moral
atmosphere of the community.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do your people never, in anger,
disappointment or unusual depression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>or excitement, injure others, or trespass
upon their rights?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Occasionally;” they admitted,
sadly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And the punishment?” We were
most curious to learn the treatment
of evil among the good.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If it be fully proved, before the
officials, one has committed a really
flagrant offense, he is uniformed in
red, as a symbol of materialistic domination,
and sent to the School of
Philosophy, where the Sages meet for
discussions. Your Socrates was a
philosopher of their class. There, he
has the best possible atmosphere in
which to recognize and correct his
faults.</p>

<p class='c007'>“During this term of reformation,
his parents, if still in the flesh, usually
wear mourning, from choice, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>recognition of their own shortcomings
during his conception or earlier
years.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How long is this term of punishment?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not punishment; development;
we consider it the Second Childhood.
The time varies from one to six
months of your counting.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We have only one bad case on
our records,” they added proudly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you allowed to state the
facts?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is of public record and History:
A father knocked down his own
son—because he kicked him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Kicked his father?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; poor little fellow!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Surely the boy should be punished;—not
the father?”</p>

<p class='c007'>After a startled glance of indignation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>which quickly faded into pity,
they continued:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Children inherit all physical
tendencies from their physical parents.
In the case under discussion, the lad
received vicious inclinations from the
father, who had, however, so controlled
his temper as to successfully pass
all ante-marriage tests.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Had he taught that son by example
the self-discipline he so well
understood, the boy would never have
disgraced us.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Through whose neglect was the
boy injured? Clearly the father’s.
The mother was also considered at
fault, to this extent:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Through a mistaken charity, a
desire to shield her beloved from
criticism, she had endured, without
complaint several outbreaks previous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>to the one reported; for this she resigned,
temporarily, her maternal
rights and colors. Our future generations
must be protected at any cost.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then she finally delivered him
over for the sake of the future?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The offense was committed in
the field and was reported by the
Agent, as it should have been by
whomever witnessed the relapse.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All feared the most disastrous
effect upon our community. You
may not fully understand that such
manifestations act as carrion, attracting
from lower atmospheres those
ravenous thought-creatures, bred by
evil-doers, and called by some of
your inspired writers, ‘Elementals’,
who swarm around unhealthy humanity,
endangering the welfare of every
sensitive organism within their reach,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>in their senseless frenzy to prolong a
shadowy and useless existence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bereft of filth, they gradually
lose their electrical vitality and
power to harm; and finally disintegrate
into crude matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This father was uniformed in
red and delegated to the School of
Philosophy for one entire season.
There he was also subjected to the
influence of most refining music, and
his reformation was complete; for we
have not a more patient and conscientious
father or husband in the city.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He was restored to his paternal
colors and is a much better man than
ever, for his victory over the parasites
that were sapping his life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>During the conversation, we
had been slowly traversing the length
of the valley, noting as we passed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>elastic health and unalloyed happiness
upon every side. Most strongly
were we impressed by the vigorous
girlish beauty of the matrons, who
were at regular intervals, as fondly
absorbed in their nursing darlings, as
the most devoted of Earth mothers.</p>

<p class='c007'>During these brief intervals,
when the Nursery knolls were thronged
with mothers, attention was called
to occasional workers, who though
resting, like the others, from their
field labors, were busily writing in
small volumes suspended from their
girdles.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Government Agents who keep
the Time accounts that the mothers
may not be harassed or disturbed;
they only of all the field workers are
not parents.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, if salaried and free, are
they timed?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>“Time is an important factor in
determining the value of the crops;
seasons differ in the amount required,
as with you.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The sod and soil must at times
be too cold and damp for these tender
human germs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We need every variation of
temperature, and are, by this close
companionship with nature, able to
absorb the physical elements which
give us strength and endurance; by
this very course, we are enabled to
preserve a youthful vigor to which
Earth-folk are strangers. During
the time of physical growth we court
every opportunity for absorbing Force;
this, assimilated, we may in later
years live according to our tastes and
preferences, as we have then the power
to attract and adjust whatever may
be required for recreation.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>We suddenly became conscious
of an uncomfortable rumbling and
jarring, similar to the sensations we
had experienced during the Earth-life,
from which we had till now seemed
so widely separated; as this confusion
ceased, we heard in those sweet tones
we were rapidly learning to love:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We will dine now, if you wish;”
and simultaneously felt ourselves
borne rapidly through space and finally
into a large, airy apartment—an
ideal dining room.</p>

<p class='c007'>We had hardly taken cognizance
of its many beauties, before we were
again attacked with the jolting, rocking,
lurching consciousness of Earth-life,
and became dimly aware of harsh
voices unpleasantly near us.——</p>

<p class='c007'>Our guides announced us simply
as “Voyagers from Earth,” in response
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>to which the matronly queen who
presided, greeted us cordially, directing
us toward capacious easy chairs
which nearly surrounded the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>After several ineffectual efforts
to rise above the haunting spectres of
our former life, we were dully conscious
of being addressed by the host,
as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your Earth People are in their
ignorance robbing you of this opportunity;
being greatly disturbed over
your absence from the body, which
they have discovered notwithstanding
our efforts to hold their attention elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The one poor harassed soul, less
gross than the rest, upon whose instincts
we have relied for your safe
return, has yielded to their importunities
sooner than we anticipated, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>has now resorted to Prayer. An earnest
Prayer to the Father from a sincere
and faithful heart is a Power we
can not safely combat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must now return; but we
will try to raise you again from the
depths, when you are in the quiet of
your own home, alone, and the prospects
are favorable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Deeply disappointed and violently
struggling against the power that
would thus wrench us from the happy
haven into which we had drifted, we
heard—O, so faintly, as from a great
distance——</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rest easily, Earth-child; you
are doing yourself only harm. All
will be made clear in the Good
Father’s own time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the horrible whistles, the
jolting of the train, and an indignant
voice saying:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>“Didn’t you see her shiver? Such
a fuss over nothing! She is coming to,
all right. Better keep your bottle for
those that need it. Some doctors think
that brandy will start or stop the universe.”
This last in an undertone.</p>

<p class='c007'>We opened our eyes very reluctantly,
to find a red-faced, wrinkled
and be-whiskered man bending over
us, with a breath strongly indicative
of the contents of a bottle held threateningly
near.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pushing it angrily away, we
exclaimed in a far-from-Reinstern-like
tone:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why are you meddling with
our affairs? We did not want to come
back yet; we have not seen the
father’s field;—not even had dinner—and
things looked so attractive!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He shook his head with a professional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>air, and murmured: “Not
right yet;—better,—decidedly better.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then we sat up as straight as a
clothes-pin, and glaring at the passengers
about our seat rudely demanded:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just trot right off about your
own affairs, now, all of you; you have
treated us shamefully, and,” we sniveled
and wept a little at this point,
“we don’t even know your names.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The conductor now interposed:
“Madam, you fainted, and but for the
kindness of this physician,—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Kindness of fiddlesticks!” we
interrupted, “we were out of town,
off on a voyage,—visiting friends,—and
should have returned in good
time, if—”</p>

<p class='c007'>The doctor hastily returned to
his post, while the others with horror-stricken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>faces, as promptly retreated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Resourceless before their suspicions,
we relinquished all intentions
to elucidate, and added, simply:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who thought we were all right
if left alone?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Whereupon a mild-mannered miss
of probably sixteen well-invested summers,
turned toward us to say, modestly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve seen people that way before;
Aunt Sophronia often is; I don’t
understand it; but you didn’t look a
bit dead.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dead!” we ejaculated; “We’d
like to die that way often, every day
or two. You must have some common
sense.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then we straightened up our
traveling cap, and stared savagely at
the outside panorama of brown fields,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>while we tried to imagine a life of
love, truth, justice, charity;—among
idiots.</p>

<p class='c007'>Later, we convinced our fellow-passengers
of our sanity, by expressing
our grateful appreciation of their
solicitude; how could they know?—and
assurance of our complete
recovery.</p>
